Bug

#### What is the expected behavior?
Components using BreakpointObserver should be destroyed when the path is changed.

#### What is the current behavior?
Components that use BreakpointObserver are not destroyed correctly causing memory leaks

#### What are the steps to reproduce?
stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/breakpoint-observer-bug (Open in new window)
github: https://github.com/alo/angular-breakpoint-observer-bug

Only start the project (github: yarn start / stackblitz: Open in new window) and navigate between the two paths (foo & bar).
Open Chrome dev tools and take a Heap Snapshot (in memory tab). You will see the component as many times as you have created it (so it has never been destroyed)
